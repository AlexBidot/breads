Building Documentation
----------------------

 - Make sure you have sphinx installed
 - in the ``breads/docs/source`` folder, edit the docs file as needed
 - in ``breads/docs`` run ``make html`` 
 - verify the edited docs look good. Iterate as needed. 
 - commit to git in a new branch and make a pull request
